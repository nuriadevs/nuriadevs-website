## Hi there! How‚Äôs it going?

Hello! I'm Nuria, a software developer specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Big Data.

I like developing mobile applications from scratch and, in the web field, I am particularly interested in the backend, where I focus on creating and optimizing infrastructures that are not visible to the user. In addition, thanks to my knowledge in artificial intelligence, I can integrate this technology into both mobile applications and web projects.

Outside the **_tech_** world, I love listening to music (which often inspires my work). I‚Äôm always on the lookout for new opportunities to learn and apply my knowledge to interesting projects.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or if you‚Äôd like some help with your next project!

Thanks for reading! üçÄ
